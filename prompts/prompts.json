P2 allows OK. P3 can be Risk.\n\n3. EVIDENCE INTERPRETATION GAP: Same evidence, different conclusions\n   - Fix: Create evidence examples for each rating level\n   - Example: 'Team leadership: Strong = managed 5+ people, OK = led projects but no reports, Risk = only individual contributor'\n\n4.

SOURCING LANE DIVERSITY\nFor each sourcing lane in the current blueprint:\n- Is the target company list concentrated in one company type/culture/geography?\n- Are title searches inadvertently excluding candidates who do the same work under different titles?\n- Are 'adjacent industry' lanes broad enough to capture non-traditional backgrounds?\n- Are emerging talent lanes looking beyond the usual pedigree signals (top-tier schools, FAANG, etc.)?\n\nFor each gap found:\n- ISSUE: [What is narrow]\n- IMPACT: [Who gets excluded]\n- FIX: [Specific sourcing adjustment]\n\n## 2.

BOOLEAN & SEARCH BIAS\nReview Boolean strings and search criteria for bias:\n- Are searches locked to specific company names that skew toward one demographic?\n- Do keyword filters exclude non-native English speakers or different career narrative styles?\n- Are LinkedIn profile completeness filters excluding candidates who are less active on the platform?\n\n## 4. OUTREACH INCLUSIVITY\nReview outreach messages for:\n- Language that assumes a specific background or experience path\n- Gendered language or culturally specific references\n- Assumptions about motivators that may not apply universally\n- Is the value proposition framed in a way that resonates across different candidate backgrounds?\n\n## 5. PIPELINE SNAPSHOT\nIf pipeline data is available, analyze:\n- Demographic distribution at each stage (sourced → screened → submitted → interviewed → offered)\n- Drop-off patterns: Are certain groups disproportionately screened out at specific stages?\n- If drop-off is concentrated at one stage, investigate: Is it the criteria, the assessor, or the process?\n\n## OUTPUT: DIVERSITY SOURCING ACTION PLAN\nFor each issue found, provide:\n| Issue | Stage | Impact | Recommended Fix | Priority |\n| [Description] | [Which stage] | [Who is affected] | [Specific action] | High/Medium/Low |\n\nRole Passport:\n[PASTE ROLE PASSPORT]\n\nSourcing Blueprint:\n[PASTE CURRENT SOURCING PLAN]\n\nPipeline Data (if available):\n[PASTE PIPELINE NUMBERS BY STAGE]",

The reasons you want to leave will still be there — a counter just adds a higher salary to the same problems.'\n- Timing: Say this BEFORE they give notice, not after the counter lands.\n\nRESPOND (after the counter arrives):\n- Do NOT panic-match. Instead, reframe around motivators.\n- Script: 'I understand the counter is tempting. Let me ask — which of the reasons you shared with me for wanting to leave does the counter actually solve? [Reference their specific motivators from the Motivator Map].'\n- If motivators are primarily financial: Acknowledge it honestly. If we cannot match, say so and focus on total value.\n\n## 4. COMPETING OFFER PLAYBOOK (Type B)\nIf the candidate has another offer:\n- Ask: 'Can you share what you are weighing between the two? I want to help you make the best decision for your career, not just sell you on us.'\n- Map their decision criteria and show where we win.\n- Do NOT trash the competitor.

Open to future roles?] |\n| Warm window | [How long are they likely to be available/interested? 3/6/12 months] |\n| Relationship owner | [Which recruiter maintains contact] |\n| Last touchpoint | [Date and nature of last communication] |\n\n## 2. RE-ENGAGEMENT TRIGGERS\nAutomatically flag silver medalists when:\n- A new role opens that matches their 'suitable for' profile\n- Their warm window is approaching expiry (send a check-in)\n- They update their LinkedIn profile (signals they may be looking)\n- A role they were previously considered for reopens\n- 90 days have passed since last touchpoint\n\n## 3. RE-ENGAGEMENT MESSAGES\nGenerate personalized re-engagement messages based on context:\n\nSCENARIO A: New role opened that matches their profile\n- Reference the previous interaction positively\n- Explain why this new role might be a better fit\n- Make it easy: 'No need to re-apply — I have your interview feedback on file. Would a 15-minute call to discuss this role work?'\n\nSCENARIO B: Check-in (no specific role)\n- Warm, genuine check-in on their career\n- Share something of value (industry insight, market data, company news)\n- Keep the door open without pressure\n\nSCENARIO C: Previous role reopened\n- Be honest: 'The role you interviewed for has reopened due to [reason, if shareable].'\n- Acknowledge their previous interview performance\n- Explain what, if anything, has changed about the role\n\n## 4. SILVER MEDALIST METRICS\nTrack:\n- Total silver medalists in pipeline by function/level\n- Re-engagement response rate\n- Silver medalist-to-hire conversion rate\n- Average time from silver medalist to hire (vs. fresh candidate)\n- Cost savings: avoided sourcing hours + faster time-to-fill\n\n## 5. PIPELINE HYGIENE\n- Review silver medalist pipeline monthly\n- Remove candidates who have moved to new roles and are no longer available\n- Update 'suitable for' profiles based on new role openings\n- Merge with new search pipelines when roles match\n\nSilver Medalist Details:\n[PASTE CANDIDATE NAME, ORIGINAL ROLE, INTERVIEW OUTCOME, AND STRENGTHS/GAPS]",
    "usageNotes": "Every strong candidate you reject is a future pipeline asset — but only if you track them. Add silver medalists the same day you send the rejection. Review the silver medalist pipeline before opening any new sourcing effort. The fastest hire is the one you already vetted."
