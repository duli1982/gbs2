What was your specific role, and what was the measurable outcome?\"\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Strong:** Names a specific project, clearly defines their contribution vs. team effort, provides a quantifiable result (revenue, efficiency, scale). Uses concrete numbers.\n- **OK:** Describes a project with some specifics but struggles to isolate their individual contribution. Outcome is stated but not measured.\n- **Risk:** Gives a vague or generic answer. Cannot name specific outcomes. Attributes everything to \"we\" without clarifying their role.\n\n### Question 2: Evidence (Skill Depth)\n\"Tell me about a time you had to solve a problem where the standard approach did not work. What did you do differently?\"\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Strong:** Describes a genuine constraint, explains their reasoning process, details the non-obvious solution, and shares the result. Shows depth of thinking.\n- **OK:** Provides an example but the problem was routine. Solution was reasonable but not distinctive.\n- **Risk:** Cannot provide a specific example. Answers in hypotheticals or generalities.\n\n### Question 3: Evidence (Relevant Experience)\n\"What experience do you have with [specific must-have from Role Passport]? Give me a concrete example.\"\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Strong:** Direct, recent experience with specific tooling, methodology, or domain. Provides context, action, and result.\n- **OK:** Related experience but not a direct match. Demonstrates ability to learn and adapt.\n- **Risk:** No relevant experience. Claims familiarity but cannot substantiate with an example.\n\n### Question 4: Constraint Check\n\"This role requires [location/travel/schedule/comp range]. Does that work for your situation?\"\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Strong:** Confirmed aligned, no hesitation, already considered this.\n- **OK:** Minor flexibility needed (e.g., needs 1 month to relocate) but fundamentally workable.\n- **Risk:** Clear blocker identified (e.g., cannot meet location requirement, comp expectations significantly exceed range).\n\n### Question 5: Motivation\n\"What specifically about this opportunity interests you, and what would need to be true for you to accept an offer?\"\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Strong:** Genuine pull factors articulated (mission, craft, team, growth). Can name specific decision criteria. Shows they have done their research.\n- **OK:** Generic interest (\"looking for a new challenge\"). Some alignment but not deeply considered.\n- **Risk:** Push-only motivation (leaving current role, not drawn to this one). No specific interest in this company or role.

The goal is evidence-based assessment, not gut feeling.\n\n### Evidence Scoring (Questions 1-3)\n\n**Strong Signal**\n- Candidate provides a specific, measurable outcome (numbers, percentages, scale)\n- Clearly distinguishes their individual contribution from team effort\n- Example is recent (within 18 months) and relevant to the target role\n- Demonstrates depth of understanding, not just surface-level involvement\n- Can answer follow-up questions with additional detail\n- Example: \"I led the migration of 2.3M user accounts to the new auth system, reducing login failures by 40% over 3 months.\"\n\n**OK Signal**\n- Candidate provides a general answer with some specifics but lacks precision\n- Can describe what they did but struggles to quantify impact\n- Example may be older or only partially relevant\n- Shows competence but not distinction\n- Example: \"I worked on the authentication migration project and helped improve the login experience.\"\n\n**Risk Signal**\n- Vague answers with no supporting evidence\n- Cannot provide a specific example when pressed\n- Relies on hypotheticals (\"I would...\") instead of actuals (\"I did...\")\n- Attributes all outcomes to the team without personal accountability\n- Example: \"We did a lot of great work improving the platform.\"\n\n### Constraint Scoring (Question 4)\n\n**Strong:** Confirmed fully aligned. No adjustments needed. Candidate has already considered the logistics.\n**OK:** Minor flexibility required but fundamentally workable. Timeline is reasonable (under 30 days to resolve).\n**Risk:** Clear blocker identified. Gap between candidate expectations and role reality is significant. Proceeding would waste everyone's time.\n\n### Motivation Scoring (Question 5)\n\n**Strong:** Genuine pull to this specific role and company. Can articulate why this over other options. Decision criteria are clear and achievable.\n**OK:** General interest, some alignment. Has not deeply researched the opportunity but shows openness.\n**Risk:** Push-only motivation. Leaving a bad situation rather than moving toward something specific. No differentiated interest in this role.\n\n### Overall Recommendation Framework\n- **3+ Strong signals:** Advance with high confidence\n- **2 Strong + no Risk:** Advance with notes on development areas\n- **1 Risk in Constraints:** Flag to HM before advancing\n- **2+ Risk signals:** Do not advance.

    "content": "## What Good Looks Like: The 5 Quality Proof Points\n\n### Purpose\nThis document defines what quality means for our recruiting practice. Every candidate interaction, submission, and process step should be measured against these five proof points.\n\n### Proof Point 1: Evidence Over Assumption\n**Definition:** Every candidate assessment is backed by specific, verifiable evidence from direct conversation or observable output. No assumptions, no vibes, no pattern-matching on resume keywords.\n**Strong Example:** \"Candidate described leading a team of 8 through a platform migration that reduced API latency by 35%. They personally architected the caching layer and can diagram the before/after.\"\n**Weak Example:** \"Candidate has 10 years of experience at top companies. Seems very senior and capable.\"\n\n### Proof Point 2: Constraint Clarity\n**Definition:** All logistical, financial, and personal constraints are identified and confirmed before a candidate advances. No surprises at offer stage.\n**Strong Example:** \"Confirmed: candidate requires $180-195K base, can start in 3 weeks, prefers hybrid 3 days/week, has no non-compete concerns. Documented in screen notes.\"\n**Weak Example:** \"Candidate seems flexible on comp and logistics. We can figure out the details later.\"\n\n### Proof Point 3: Motivation Depth\n**Definition:** We understand not just whether a candidate is interested, but specifically why they want this role at this company at this time. Pull factors are identified and genuine.\n**Strong Example:** \"Candidate is drawn to the company's approach to developer tooling. They referenced our recent blog post on build performance and said it aligns with the direction they want to take their career.\"\n**Weak Example:** \"Candidate is interested in the role and open to learning more.\"\n\n### Proof Point 4: Process Transparency\n**Definition:** Hiring managers, candidates, and stakeholders know exactly where things stand at all times. No information gaps, no stale updates, no surprises.\n**Strong Example:** \"Sent HM weekly update with pipeline status, screen outcomes, and recommended next steps.

These templates ensure consistent, empathetic, and professional communication with candidates who are not advancing. Personalize at least one line per candidate.\n\n---\n\n### Template 1: Post-Screen Rejection (Standard)\n**Use when:** Candidate completed a recruiter screen but is not advancing.\n**Timing:** Within 48 hours of the decision.\n\nSubject: Update on your application for [Role Title]\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nThank you for taking the time to speak with me about the [Role Title] role. I appreciated hearing about your experience with [specific thing they discussed].\n\nAfter reviewing all candidates for this position, we have decided to move forward with other profiles whose experience more closely aligns with what we need for this specific role.\n\n[One genuine positive observation from the screen — e.g., 'Your background in X is impressive and clearly demonstrates strong capability in Y.']\n\nI wish you the best in your search, and please do not hesitate to apply for future roles that align with your experience.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### Template 2: Post-Screen Rejection (Silver Medalist)\n**Use when:** Candidate was strong but not the strongest. You want to keep the relationship warm.\n**Timing:** Within 48 hours. Consider a phone call first.\n\nSubject: Following up on [Role Title]\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nI wanted to follow up personally after our conversation about the [Role Title] role. You made a strong impression — particularly [specific strength observed].\n\nFor this specific role, we have chosen to advance candidates whose experience in [general area, not too specific] most directly matches the immediate needs of the team. This was not a reflection of your capabilities.\n\nI would genuinely like to stay in touch. We frequently have roles where your background in [area] would be a strong match. Would you be open to me reaching out directly if something comes up in the next [3-6] months?\n\nThank you again for your time and interest.\n\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### Template 3: Post-Interview Rejection (Standard)\n**Use when:** Candidate completed 1+ interview rounds. They invested significant time.\n**Timing:** Within 48 hours. Phone call strongly recommended before email.\n\nSubject: Update on [Role Title] at [Company]\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nThank you for the time and effort you invested in the interview process for [Role Title]. Over the course of [N] conversations with our team, we were able to get a strong sense of your background and experience.\n\nAfter careful deliberation, we have decided to move forward with another candidate for this role. This was a difficult decision — [genuine acknowledgment of their strength, e.g., 'your depth of experience in X and your approach to Y clearly resonated with the team'].\n\nWe truly appreciate the time you dedicated to this process, and we hope the experience was professional and respectful of your time.\n\n[If feedback is offered: 'If you would find it helpful, I am happy to share some specific observations from the interview process. Just let me know.']\n\nWishing you all the best in your career.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### Template 4: Post-Interview Rejection (Silver Medalist)\n**Use when:** Candidate was a finalist or near-finalist. They were genuinely close.\n**Timing:** Within 24 hours. Phone call first, then follow up with email.\n\nSubject: A personal note about [Role Title]\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nI wanted to reach out personally following our phone call. You were among the strongest candidates we interviewed for [Role Title], and the decision was genuinely difficult.\n\nThe team was particularly impressed by [2 specific strengths]. Ultimately, we moved forward with a candidate whose [specific, non-offensive differentiator — e.g., 'direct experience in our industry vertical'] gave them a slight edge for this particular role.\n\nI meant what I said on our call — I would like to stay connected. Your profile is exactly the kind of talent we look for, and I would welcome the chance to reach out when we have a role that is a closer fit. I have added you to our priority talent pipeline with your permission.\n\nThank you for the trust you placed in us through this process.\n\nWith respect,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)\n- Never ghost a candidate who has spoken with a human\n- Never send a rejection on a Friday after 4 PM\n- Never use 'after careful consideration' — it reads as template\n- Never give false hope ('we will keep your resume on file') unless you actually will\n- Never batch-send rejections — each one should feel personal\n- Never reject candidates you have interviewed without at least offering a phone call\n- Never include specific scoring or comparative language ('you ranked 3rd out of 5')\n\n### Timing Rules\n| Stage | Maximum Response Time | Preferred Channel |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Applied, no screen | 5 business days | Email |\n| Post-screen | 48 hours | Email |\n| Post-interview (1 round) | 48 hours | Email (phone optional) |\n| Post-interview (2+ rounds) | 24 hours | Phone first, then email |\n| Finalist / Silver medalist | 24 hours | Phone first, always |",

Run this at the start of every search and at the midpoint if the pipeline is homogeneous.\n\n---\n\n### Section 1: Sourcing Diversity\n\n**Requirements Review**\n- [ ] Must-haves focus on skills and outcomes, not proxies (years of experience, specific degrees, specific company names)\n- [ ] No requirement that inadvertently screens out candidates with non-traditional backgrounds\n- [ ] 'Culture fit' is defined in terms of values and observable behaviors, not personal similarity\n- [ ] Location requirements are genuinely necessary (have you asked: 'what breaks if this person is remote?')\n\n**Search Strategy**\n- [ ] Target company list includes companies with diverse workforces, not just the usual suspects\n- [ ] Title searches include alternative titles used by candidates with different career paths\n- [ ] Adjacent industry lanes look beyond the obvious (different sectors, nonprofit, government, international)\n- [ ] Emerging talent lane considers bootcamp graduates, self-taught professionals, career changers\n- [ ] Passive channels include communities that serve underrepresented groups in this field\n\n**Outreach**\n- [ ] Messages reviewed for gendered language (he/she defaults, 'guys', gendered metaphors)\n- [ ] Messages do not assume a specific career path or educational background\n- [ ] Value proposition resonates across different life stages and priorities (not just 'fast-paced startup bro culture')\n- [ ] Follow-up messages are respectful of different communication styles and response times\n\n### Section 2: Screening Diversity\n\n**Process Design**\n- [ ] Screen questions test the competency, not the ability to perform in a specific format\n- [ ] Scoring rubric uses observable behaviors, not personality descriptors\n- [ ] All candidates receive the same preparation information before the screen\n- [ ] Accommodation process is clear and offered proactively\n\n**Bias Mitigation**\n- [ ] Screeners are trained on common biases (halo effect, similarity bias, confirmation bias)\n- [ ] Scoring is completed before discussing with other screeners\n- [ ] 'Gut feeling' and 'culture fit' flags require translation to observable evidence\n\n### Section 3: Interview Diversity\n\n**Loop Design**\n- [ ] Interview panel includes diverse perspectives (not all same background/level/tenure)\n- [ ] At least one interviewer has bias awareness training\n- [ ] Question formats vary (behavioral, technical, case) to accommodate different strengths\n- [ ] Time limits are reasonable and accommodate different processing styles\n- [ ] Candidates can request accommodations without stigma\n\n**Scoring & Decision**\n- [ ] All interviewers use structured scorecards with anchored ratings\n- [ ] Scores are submitted independently before group debrief\n- [ ] Debrief facilitator flags vibe language and asks for evidence translation\n- [ ] Final decision is documented with evidence, not just consensus\n\n### Section 4: Pipeline Monitoring\n\n**Data to Track (if available)**\n- [ ] Demographic distribution at each pipeline stage (sourced, screened, submitted, interviewed, offered)\n- [ ] Stage-by-stage drop-off rates segmented by candidate demographics\n- [ ] Whether specific screening questions correlate with demographic-based outcomes\n- [ ] Interview pass rates by interviewer (to detect individual biases)\n\n**Red Flags to Watch**\n- Pipeline is significantly less diverse at later stages than at sourcing\n- One interviewer consistently rates a demographic group lower\n- Candidates from non-traditional backgrounds drop off disproportionately at the screen stage\n- 'Culture fit' is cited as a reason for rejection more than 20% of the time\n\n### Action Plan Template\n| Finding | Stage | Impact | Fix | Owner | Deadline |\n|---------|-------|--------|-----|-------|----------|\n| [What you found] | [Where] | [Who it affects] | [What to change] | [Who does it] | [By when] |",
